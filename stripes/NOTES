it looks like its disputed whether electron-electron or electron-phonon interaction leads to stripes
in cuprates and nickelate. see 'refs'. my first pass wants to look at how electron-electron induced 
stripes couple to phonons. second pass would be self-consistent solution w/ phonons to see 
a) electron-phonon induced stripes w/o electron-electron interactions (i.e. no hubbard-U) and b)
stripes w/ both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.
