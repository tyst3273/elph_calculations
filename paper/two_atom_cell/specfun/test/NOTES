i am removing the degeneracy of electronic eigenvalues according to 
    http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.76.165108 

then i set the 1st non-zero element of each eigenvector to be real for each band. not sure if this
    actually fixes the gauge ... ?

OH! the eigenvectors of the perturbation matrix arent the new eigenvectors, they are the expansion
coefficients of the subspace eigenvectors ... see eq. 38
