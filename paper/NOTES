in my hbco_zone_center_eph doc, the band is s-like spanning ~ -1 to 2 eV, i.e. width ~ 3 eV.
The bond-stretching manifold goes from ~ 55 meV to 70 meV. 

with t=1, the bandwidth is 8 t. multiplied 3/8 eV, band with is 3 eV. with m=1, M=4, K=0.015, 
and k=0.002, the phonons are from ~ 0.2 to 0.17 eV. times 3/8, these are from ~ 75 meV to
60 meV. this is pretty close to what we want :)

to do:
    AFM-I: x=0.5, U=1
    AFM-I: x=0.5, U=2
    AFM-I: x=0.5, U=6
    AMF-M: x=0.4, U=4
    PM-M: x=0.25, U=4
    FM-M: x=0.25, U=10
    FiM-M: x=0.45, U=6
    smaller gap ~ order of phonon energies
    parallel stripes? 
    diagonal stripes?
