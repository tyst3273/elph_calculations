i am removing the degeneracy of electronic eigenvalues according to 
    http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.76.165108 

then i set the 1st non-zero element of each eigenvector to be real for each band. not sure if this
    actually fixes the gauge ... ?

OH! the eigenvectors of the perturbation matrix arent the new eigenvectors, they are the expansion
coefficients of the subspace eigenvectors ... see eq. 38

STATUS: parallelized it, but not correctly yet. each call to fix_gauge uses "this_kpt" etc to get 
eigenvalues and vectors from global array, but that isnt in the scope. not until each proc returns
its stuff
